## Directory/File Structure

```
ðŸ“¦ apps
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ connect
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ app
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ App.tsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ Providers.tsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ Routes.tsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ store.ts
 â”— ...other apps
ðŸ“¦ mfe
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ contacts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ common-ui
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ feature-core
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ components
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ hooks
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ contacts.slice.ts
 â”— ...other micro frontends
 ðŸ“¦ shared
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ common-ui
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ components
 â”— ...other shared libs
```

- Apps contain all of our applications that would get deployed
  - Should have an app folder that describes all of the application's routes and reducers
  - They should not contain any components, services, or business logic and only wire up shared micro frontends
  - They are basically just the glue that holds everything together
- MFE contain code that should be shared to build up applications
  - Can contain a common-ui folder that contains shared components that relate only to the micro frontend
  - Micro frontends should be split by business domain and have a set of features that relates only to that micro frontend
    - A feature should be a set of components, hooks, and a redux slice
    - Directory should be named like `feature-{feature name}`
    - Features should not be nested inside each other
    - It might take multiple features to actually make up a whole view
- Shared are more common components and utilities
  - Common-ui would just be shared presentational components (dumb components) or components that just use local state
    - Usually components are created in their respected library, but once they need to be shared between multiple libraries they should be made more generic and put in common-ui
  - Utilities library for maybe test or helper functions

This similar type of file structure is strongly recommended in the [Redux style guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide#structure-files-as-feature-folders-or-ducks) and has personally worked very well for me for years in large frontend react projects.

## Component Folder Structure

```
ðŸ“‚ components
 â”£ ðŸ“œ Rating.stories.tsx
 â”£ ðŸ“œ Rating.test.tsx
 â”£ ðŸ“œ Rating.tsx
```

It should be very easy to locate everything related to a component (story, test and styles). Styles and stories shouldn't be nested away in their own directories. Although it is from John Papa's AngularJS style guide I am a big fan of the [LIFT principle](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#lift).

## Redux

This application uses [redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) which is the official optionated toolkit created by the maintainers of redux. It is a great approach to writing redux code because it reduces boilerplate and has a great API to reduce complexity. The application also features the concept of [injectable redux reducers](https://redux.js.org/recipes/code-splitting/#defining-an-injectreducer-function).

Following [the redux style guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide) is also very important.

## Typescript

This application also uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I've been using it in professional applications since the AngularJS 1.x days. You donâ€™t need to use crazy advanced types, but leveraging just the TS compiler and having types instead of prop-types can reduce bugs and make for a better developer experience. It also allows for better refactoring and helps to establish interfaces for API payloads.
